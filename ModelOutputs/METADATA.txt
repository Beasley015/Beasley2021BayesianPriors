Files herein contain posterior distributions for Bayesian MSOMs associated with 
Beasley (2021).

---------------------------------------------

The following contain posteriors of models analyzing data from a simulated community:

"mod_noaug.rds": posteriors of model in which undetected species were not accounted for

"mod_uninf.rds": model in which undetected species were accounted for by augmenting
the dataset with all-zero encounter histories, and uninformed priors were used for 
these species.

prefix "inf_": models in which undetected species were accounted for (see above), but
informed priors were used to model undetected species. Strength of the informed prior 
was weak, moderate, or strong.

prefix "misinf_": models in which undetected species were accounted for (see above), but
misinformed priors were used to model undetected species. These models were used to test
what would happen if the information supplied to the model was wrong or misleading.
Strength of the informed prior was weak, moderate, or strong.

-----------------------------------------------

The following contain posteriors of models analyzing empirical data from small mammal
communities throughout Vermont, USA, collected in summer 2019. 

"real_uninf.rds": model using uninformed priors for all species in the model, detected
and undetected

"real_weakinf": model using weakly informative priors for undetected species

"real_modinf": model using moderately informative priors for undetected species

-------------------------------------------

"sample_mod.rds" is the posterior distribution for the model in Appendix S3, using
a simulated community of 10 species.
