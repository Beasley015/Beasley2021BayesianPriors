File VegRawData.csv contains vegetation data. Data was collected within a 0.5x0.5m quadrat
placed in the center of each trap station. Key to column abbreviations:

Habitat-Station: See above.

Canopy: Average canopy cover index taken facing four cardinal directions. Values range
from 0-24. 

Weins10-Weins60: Number of points where living vegetation touched a 1/4" pole at 
10-cm intervals. Serves as an index of vertical complexity.

%Tree: amount of tree cover in sampling quadrat

%Shrub: amount of shrub cover in sampling quadrat

%Grass: amount of grass cover in sampling quadrat

%Forb: amount of herbacious vegetation in the sampling quadrat that does not fall under
any of the above categories

%Bare: amount of exposed ground in the sampling quadrat

%DeadVeg: amount of dead vegetation (e.g. dead leaves, mats of grass) in the sampling
quadrat
